 Due to time constraints and every time that i looked into the code I started thinking of more stuff to add there will be more updates when i get time to add the stuff properly
 
 Resuming what this site does:
 
 Me and @TubalhaoSpartan initially  tried doing this using flutter, dart and a version of leaflet.js for the latter but after looking into the docs and trying stuff we concluded that there was not enoght time, so we went for the other languages that we learned this semester HTML, CSS + Bootstrap, PHP and JavaScript
